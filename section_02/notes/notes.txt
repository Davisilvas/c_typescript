types **************************

CORE TYPES
Number : includes the integers and floats. (1, 5.3, -10)
string : text. Allows to use template literals.
boolean : true or false. It doesn't includes the 0 and 1.


type inference means that TS does it's best to understand wich type you have in a certain var or const.


##########

Array - Any Js array. Type can be flexible or strict (regarding the element types).

Tuple - Added by TS: fixed-length array. 

When the tuple finally gets converted to array when compiled to JS, JS will treat it as a normal array. But during TS development we'll get errors if we get to make one.

In TS a push is acceptable. So we'll won't get any errors durign development. Gotta stay alert to this.

But trying to assign a new value by the following syntax we'll get an error.
    person.role = [0, 'aaa', 'bbb'] 
And that's because during role first assignment we stated that it would have only 2 itens. So we can conclude that length is enforced if we assign a tuple


########## Lesson 20 - Working with enums

Enum Type

It does exists in other programing languages, but in vanilla JS don't.

Enum sample -> enum{NEW, OLD}

Added by TS: automatically enumerated global constant identifiers.
